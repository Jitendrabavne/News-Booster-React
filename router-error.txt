 I don't know why I am getting this error and I can't find an answer for it anywhere. 
 I have uninstalled the react-router-dom package and reinstalled it, but it continues to tell me that the switch 
 module is not exported from react-router-dom. Here's my code. 
Error I'm getting: Attempted import error: 'Switch' is not exported from 'react-router-dom'.  
I also faced the same problem, and I search towards the internet so much but
 I didn't get any answer according to my question. 

    So I uninstall the version 6 of react-router-dom
----------(npm uninstall react-router-dom)----------

    And installed version 5.2.0 of react-router-dom
----------(npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0)----------

for react Infinity scrolling module
-----------(npm i react-infinite-scroll-component)-------

for react top loading bar
---------(npm i react-top-loading-bar)---------



new file is
 ------------(.env.local)-------------
 and this already added in .gitignore file ---
 thats use in this file  if the module name is starting with REACT_APP_NEWS_API
  then we will use them in our project
  ------(REACT_APP_NEWS_API)------
